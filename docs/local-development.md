# Sigstore HPE POC

Local development environment for exercising Tekton and Sigstore running on kind. There are two example pipelines, one for Python and one for Go.

**Note**: We have to use `--allow-insecure-registry` due to this [cosign bug](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/issues/1405).

## Notes for macOS

You may hit file limits; you can run `sudo launchctl limit maxfiles 65536 200000` to remediate that issue.

The airplay receiver uses port 5000, which may need to be disabled. Further details via [Apple's developer forum](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/682332). Alternatively, you can manually modify the script and change the [REGISTRY_PORT](https://github.com/vaikas/sigstore-scaffolding/blob/main/hack/setup-mac-kind.sh#L19)

# Prerequisites

In order to run through this example, you will need the following installed:

 * Docker
 * [tkn cli](https://tekton.dev/docs/cli/)
 * kubectl
 * rekor-cli
 * cosign

# Setup Kubernetes cluster

We will setup the local Kubernetes cluster by running the `/hack/kind/setup-kind.sh` script from the root of this repository.

```shell
./hack/kind/setup-kind.sh
```

This script will set up a local Kubernetes kind cluster on your machine with:

 * Knative serving
 * sigstore (Rekor, Fulcio, etc.)
 * Tekton Chains / Pipelines
 * Tekton task for fetching GitHub sources

This setup will take a few minutes. Note that you will be prompted for your root password while running the setup script. 

**Note**: You may see some errors similar to the following while the script is running. This is fine.

```
Error from server (InternalError): error when creating "https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/chains/latest/release.yaml": Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "config.webhook.pipeline.tekton.dev": Post "https://tekton-pipelines-webhook.tekton-pipelines.svc:443/config-validation?timeout=10s": dial tcp 10.96.244.5:443: connect: connection refused
```

They are due to some race conditions when installing Tekton components. There are retries built in, so as long things finish, it's ok. Cleaning those up will require some upstream work.

Once you get output that ends in the `::endgroup::` line, you'll know this initial setup is completed. The last few lines of the output should resemble the following.

```
...
configmap/dashboard-info created
service/tekton-dashboard created
deployment.apps/tekton-dashboard created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/tekton-dashboard-tenant created
::endgroup::
```

If you run `docker ps -a` at this point, you should have 3 containers, including a `registry.local`, a `sigstore-worker`, and a `sigstore-control-plane`. 

### Verify sigstore installs

There are two jobs that run to verify the installation. The first is `check-oidc` which signs an image with Cosign, and the second is `checktree` which ensures it's properly added to the Rekor transparency log. Both of them should show `1/1` completions.

```bash
kubectl get jobs
```

```
NAME         COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
check-oidc   1/1           40s        9m19s
checktree    1/1           59s        9m19s
```

You can get the completed pod logs next.

```bash
for i in `kubectl get pods | grep Completed | awk -F " " '{print $1}'`
do
kubectl logs $i
done
```

A small snippet of the output you get should be similar to the following. 

```

```

We will need to setup port forwarding at this point.

```shell
kubectl -n kourier-system port-forward service/kourier-internal 8080:80 &
```

Now, you'll be able to test Rekor.

```bash
curl http://rekor.rekor-system.svc:8080/api/v1/log/
```

Running the above should generate output that resembles the following. 

```
{
  "rootHash":"e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855",

  "treeSize":0
}
```

At this point, we can move onto Tekton. 

# Tekton overview

## Network access

### Adding localhost entries to make tools usable

First, add the following entries to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```
127.0.0.1 rekor.rekor-system.svc
127.0.0.1 fulcio.fulcio-system.svc
127.0.0.1 ctlog.ctlog-system.svc
```

This makes using tooling easier, for example:

```shell
rekor-cli --rekor_server http://rekor.rekor-system.svc:8080 loginfo
```

After smoke tests have successfully completed, you'll receive output similar to this: 

```
No previous log state stored, unable to prove consistency
Verification Successful!
Tree Size: 1
Root Hash: 062e2fa50e2b523f9cfd4eadc4b67745436226d64bf9799d57c5dc023681c4b8
Timestamp: 2022-02-04T22:09:46Z
```

If you run through this example more than once, you can remove the `/.rekor/state.json` file in order to get verification output again. Or alternatively you can invoke rekor-cli with `--store_tree_state=false` flag. Otherwise rekor-cli will complain that the state of the tree is suspect (which it is, since we recreated it :) ).

### Certificates

There are two certificates that we need; the CT Log and Fulcio root certs. Note that if you are switching back and forth between public and your instance, you may not want to export these variables (or unexport them when switching to public instances).

Get the CT Log public certificate:

```shell
kubectl -n ctlog-system get secrets ctlog-public-key -o=jsonpath='{.data.public}' | base64 -d > ./ctlog-public.pem
export SIGSTORE_CT_LOG_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE=./ctlog-public.pem
```

Now get the Fulcio root certificate:

```shell
kubectl -n fulcio-system get secrets fulcio-secret -ojsonpath='{.data.cert}' | base64 -d > ./fulcio-root.pem
export SIGSTORE_ROOT_FILE=./fulcio-root.pem
```

# Running through Tekton tasks

Once you've installed the above, you can install the Tekton task and pipeline pieces. This is a very rough beginning of a proper Python pipeline and is meant to demonstrate breaking the large build into multiple steps and providing attestations at each level via Tekton Chains.

## Install tasks and pipelines

Run the following with `kubectl` to install all the tasks that are needed for the pipeline

```shell
kubectl apply -f ./config/common/
kubectl apply -f ./config/python/
kubectl apply -f ./config/go/
```

After these tasks are created, check to ensure what is installed.

```shell
kubectl get tasks,pipelines
```

Ensure that your output matches the following tasks and pipelines.

```
NAME                                          AGE
task.tekton.dev/git-clone                     61s
task.tekton.dev/install-go-dependencies       38s
task.tekton.dev/install-python-dependencies   44s
task.tekton.dev/kaniko                        61s
task.tekton.dev/ko-build-image                38s
task.tekton.dev/list-dependencies             61s

task.tekton.dev/scan-trivy                    61s
task.tekton.dev/sign-image                    61s

NAME                                        AGE
pipeline.tekton.dev/go-build-pipeline       38s
pipeline.tekton.dev/python-build-pipeline   44s
```

We'll run the Python pipeline next. 

## Run Python pipeline

Run the python pipeline like so:

```shell
kubectl apply -f ./config/kind/python-pipelinerun-kind.yaml
```

The pipeline should complete successfully, which you can follow along by checking the pipeline runs.

```shell
kubectl get pipelineruns -w
```

```
bare-build-pipeline-run   True        Succeeded   6h13m       6h12m
```

You can view the logs of the pipeline run with the [tkn cli](https://tekton.dev/docs/cli/).

```shell
tkn pipelineruns logs bare-build-pipeline-run -f
```

If you have Tekton dashboard installed, you can run the below to view it.

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/tekton-dashboard 9097:9097 -n tekton-pipelines
```

![Screenshot of Tekton dashboard](../images/tekton-dashboards.png)

When the pipeline finishes, you'll receive the following output in the logs.

```shell
[source-to-image : build-and-push] INFO[0008] Pushing image to registry.local:5000/knative/pythontest:0.1
[source-to-image : build-and-push] INFO[0010] Pushed image to 1 destinations


[source-to-image : digest-to-results] sha256:824e9a8a00d5915bc87e25316dfbb19dbcae292970b02a464e2da1a665c7d54b
```

![Tekton pipeline](../images/tekton-pipeline.png)

## Inspect results

As part of the pipeline run we create a container image for it, sign it with Cosign, create an SBOM, and perform a Trivy scan for it.

To review the concise and clear overview of the pipeline run, use the tkn cli. 

```
tkn pr describe bare-build-pipeline-run
```

You can review the digest in the **Results** section. To reduce cutting and pasting, let's grab it into an `ENV` variable for later steps:

```shell
IMAGE_ID=$(kubectl get taskruns bare-build-pipeline-run-source-to-image -o jsonpath='{.spec.params[0].value}' | awk -F ":" '{print $1":"$2}')@$(kubectl get taskruns bare-build-pipeline-run-source-to-image -o jsonpath='{.status.taskResults[0].value}')
```

You should get output that looks something like so:

```shell
echo $IMAGE_ID
registry.local:5000/knative/pythontest@sha256:aebbd2977c66b5a5f53fe9af2a52ae129203e560cb7480930535124874a6e3b1
```

Verify that the image was signed.

```shell
COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign verify --allow-insecure-registry --rekor-url=http://rekor.rekor-system.svc:8080 --allow-insecure-registry $IMAGE_ID
```

After running the above, you should get output similar to this.

```
Verification for registry.local:5000/knative/pythontest@sha256:63ac5cfea7d421d92635f97e9e014b5ceed0613566d52111f990b6076e564905 --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - The claims were present in the transparency log
  - The signatures were integrated into the transparency log when the certificate was valid
  - Any certificates were verified against the Fulcio roots.

  [{"critical":{"identity":{"docker-reference":"registry.local:5000/knative/pythontest"},"image":{"docker-manifest-digest":"sha256:63a<SNIPPED HERE FOR READABILITY>
```

Now, let's download the SBOM.

```shell
COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign download sbom --allow-insecure-registry $IMAGE_ID > /tmp/sbom
```

You can look at the `/tmp/sbom` file and it should look like this:

Get the Trivy scan result.

```shell
COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign verify-attestation --rekor-url=http://rekor.rekor-system.svc:8080 --allow-insecure-registry $IMAGE_ID > /tmp/attestations
```

Finally, you should get this output that verifies everything was validated.

```shell
Verification for gcr.io/chainguard-dev/pythontest@sha256:c089acd03a21830c329d70f61cefa2a29c43e59ebc848581043b631451dfffa7 --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - The claims were present in the transparency log
  - The signatures were integrated into the transparency log when the certificate was valid
  - Any certificates were verified against the Fulcio roots.
```

Verify the Tekton Chains by choosing one of the steps. We can do this for any of the taskruns, but let's do the one that does the build. Tekton stores this information in the Taskrun annotations, so let's pull out the transparency entry.

```shell
kubectl get taskruns bare-build-pipeline-run-source-to-image -ojsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.chains\.tekton\.dev/transparency}'
```

This should print something similar to the following.

```
kubectl get taskruns bare-build-pipeline-run-source-to-image -ojsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.chains\.tekton\.dev/transparency}'
http://rekor.rekor-system.svc/api/v1/log/entries?logIndex=40%
```

We can then fetch the corresponding entry from the Rekor log with:

```shell
TRANSPARENCY_INDEX=$(kubectl get taskruns bare-build-pipeline-run-source-to-image -ojsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.chains\.tekton\.dev/transparency}' | awk -F "=" '{print $2}')
rekor-cli --rekor_server http://rekor.rekor-system.svc:8080 get --log-index $TRANSPARENCY_INDEX > /tmp/transparency
```

We can then look at that file with `less`/`vi` and we can format the actual attestation nicely with this:

```shell
grep Attestation /tmp/transparency | awk -F " " '{print $2}' | base64 -d | jq -r .
```

The above should print something like this:

```shell
{
  "_type": "https://in-toto.io/Statement/v0.1",
  "predicateType": "https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2",
  "subject": null,
  "predicate": {
    "builder": {
      "id": "https://tekton.dev/chains/v2"
    },
.......
```

Chains also adds the signature and payload to annotations of a taskrun, and you can pull them out like this:

```shell
TASKRUN_UID=$(kubectl get taskruns bare-build-pipeline-run-source-to-image -ojsonpath='{.metadata.uid}')
tkn tr describe --last -o jsonpath="{.metadata.annotations.chains\.tekton\.dev/signature-taskrun-$TASKRUN_UID}" > signature
tkn tr describe --last -o jsonpath="{.metadata.annotations.chains\.tekton\.dev/payload-taskrun-$TASKRUN_UID}" | base64 -d > payload
```

***TODO(vaikas): THIS STEP DOES NOT WORK YET WITH INDEXING ISSUES***
Then you can verify the integrity by running cosign again:

```
COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign verify-blob --rekor-url=http://rekor.rekor-system.svc:8080 --allow-insecure-registry --signature ./signature ./payload
```

# Cleaning up

To clean up the cluster as well as a local Docker registry daemon container, run `/hack/kind/teardown-kind.sh` script from the root of this repository.

```shell
./hack/kind/teardown-kind.sh
```
